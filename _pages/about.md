Since October 2025, I am a postdoc researcher at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/), [Algebra Section](https://wis.kuleuven.be/algebra),
mentored by [Raf Cluckers](https://rcluckers.perso.math.cnrs.fr/). 

Before that, 
I was an [IST-BRIDGE](https://ist.ac.at/en/education/postdocs/ist-bridge/) 
& [Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellow](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101034413/en)
in [Tim Browning's group](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/browning-group/), 
[ISTA](https://ist.ac.at).

I completed my PhD in Summer 2023,
under the supervision of [Emmanuel Peyre](https://www-fourier.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/~peyre) at 
[Institut Fourier](https://www-fourier.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr),
[Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/). 

I graduated from [École polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) in 2020 (X2016).

## mathematical interests 

Classical and motivic aspects of a certain number of topics in
- algebraic geometry: Cox rings and applications (distribution of rational points on varieties, moduli spaces of curves, ...), stacks of G-bundles;
- analytic number theory: circle method, harmonic analysis, zeta functions and their applications to geometry and arithmetics;
- logic: model theory for motivic integration and applications to arithmetics.

## contact 
my-first-name dot my-last-name at kuleuven.be

In my native language (French), my first name is gender neutral. 
Its pronouciation is close to that of Louis in English but is different: in ˈluːɪs you have to replace uː by əʊ (like the final o in tomato) to get ˈləʊɪs (and pronounce the final s if you did not).
My pronouns in English are he/him/his/they/them/their. You can write to me in English, French, Spanish or Italian.
