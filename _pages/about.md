Since December 2023, I am a postdoc researcher in mathematics, 
working as an [IST-BRIDGE](https://ist.ac.at/en/education/postdocs/ist-bridge/) 
& [Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellow](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101034413/en)
in [Tim Browning's group](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/browning-group/), 
[IST Austria](https://ist.ac.at).

Previously, I completed my PhD 
under the supervision of [Emmanuel Peyre](https://www-fourier.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/~peyre) at 
[Institut Fourier](https://www-fourier.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr),
[Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/). 

## mathematical interests 

My research lies at the intersection between algebraic geometry and number theory. 

I study geometric objects such as moduli spaces of curves on varieties, 
using (which actually means also developping) motivic analogues of tools coming from algebraic or analytic number theory (theory of valuation rings, harmonic analysis, circle method, Cox rings and universal torsors...). 
Here is [a poster with some pictures](/assets/pdf/poster-motivic-distribution-of-curves.pdf) I made recently concerning motivic distribution of curves.

More broadly speaking, I am interested in the following topics:
- moduli spaces of curves, bundles...
- distribution of rational points/curves on varieties and variants such as Campana points/curves (Manin's program and its variants)
- $$p$$-adic/motivic integration, applications to geometry, topology and arithmetics
- birational geometry, applications to arithmetics
- analytic number theory, applications to algebraic geometry
