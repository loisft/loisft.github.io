In May I will give a talk at the [Groups, Arithmetic & Algebraic Geometry Seminar at EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/arg/arg-chair-of-arithmetic-geometry/research/)
and 
attend the first [meeting of the ERC 'Groups of Algebraic Transformations'](https://perso.univ-rennes1.fr/serge.cantat/ERCMeeting1.html) in Rennes, France.
