It's my birthday and the video of my talk <i>Asymptotic behaviour of rational curves</i> 
at the CIRM thematic meeting 
["Algebraic Geometry and Complex Geometry"](https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/2605.html)
is now [online on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeXfvb-y-NY) !
Many thanks to the organisers and to the whole CIRM team.
